      description: >-
        The healthcheck API is used by Honeybadger to monitor the health and uptime
        of the Rails app.


        It performs a few simple checks;

        1. Checks the API is up and accessible

        2. Check the database is available and we can read/write to it

        3. Checks that Redis is available and we can read/write to it

        4. Checks there are no push notifications stuck processing


        If all checks pass, the API returns a `200` response code, otherwise it returns
        a `500`.
