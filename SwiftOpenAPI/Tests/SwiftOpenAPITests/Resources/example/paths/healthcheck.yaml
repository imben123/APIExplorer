  description: >-
    The healthcheck API is used by Honeybadger to monitor the health and uptime of
    the Rails app.


    It performs a few simple checks;

    1. Checks the API is up and accessible

    2. Check the database is available and we can read/write to it

    3. Checks that Redis is available and we can read/write to it

    4. Checks there are no push notifications stuck processing


    If all checks pass, the API returns a `200` response code, otherwise it returns
    a `500`.
